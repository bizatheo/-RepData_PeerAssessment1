I know there are already posted answers above but I wanted to give my solution in windows 
for uploading to github. It was excrutiatingly painful to figure this out even with the help.

1. Fork repository from github.com
2. make a new folder in your computer with nothing inside it
3. open up git bash and cd into the new directory. 
4. $ git init
5. $ git remote add origin <https://github.com/user name/RepData_PeerAssessment1.git>
6. $ git pull origin master
7. Open up windows explorer and see that your newly created folder suddenly has all the original files
8. Copy and paste your Rmd file, html file and figures folder created by knitr in your R working directory into your git folder
9. $ git add .
10. $ git commit - m "some message"
11. $ git push origin master

I've even taken the data scientist toolkit  but there was very little practice with git itself so I still feel very uncomfortable with it all
